How to contribute
-----------------

Feel free to create a pull request for fixes and improvements. Make sure to write the content of the changes in the description of the pull request, and follow the rules to commit messages. GitHub provides a `short help page <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_ and an `elaborative documentation <https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/>`_ on collaborating on projects.

For the detailed information about git and commit messages, refer to the CONTRIBUTION.md file.

In order to contribute to the project, you must have signed the `Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) <http://developercertificate.org/>`_. It certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
